    description:
      "Drawing inspiration from science fiction luminaries like Ray Bradbury, Alain Damasio, George Orwell, Aldous Huxley, and Isaac Asimov, Panopticon reflects the genre's core concepts: technology will deeply transform humanity and the way humans behave with each others. Virtuality will overshadow the real world and people will mostly interact with avatars or robots. Innovation - if not mastered - will create even more social fracture instead of bringing people together. Visually the collection is widely inspired by anime culture, from Paprika and Full Metal Alchemist to Akira and Evangelion, the bright colors, shapes and movement defined the global direction of Panopticon. Straying from either techno-solutionism or techno-doom, Teto navigates a middle ground, mitigating and balancing these extremes in a vibrant, dynamic, and impactful manner.",
